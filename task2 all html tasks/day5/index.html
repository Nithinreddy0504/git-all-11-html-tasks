            <p>The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC; ISO: Saṁgha Loka Sevā Āyoga) is a constitutional body tasked with recruiting officers for All India Services and the Central Civil Services (Group A and B) through various standardized examinations.[1] In 2023, 1.3 million applicants competed for just 1,255 positions.[2]

                The agency's charter is granted by Part XIV of the Constitution of India, titled Services Under the Union and the States.[3][4] The commission is mandated by the Constitution for appointments to the services of the Union and All India Services. It is also required to be consulted by the Government in matters relating to appointment, transfer, promotion, and disciplinary matters. The commission reports directly to the President. The commission can advise the Government through the president, although, such advice is not binding. Being a constitutional authority, UPSC is amongst the few institutions that function with both autonomy and freedom, along with the country’s higher judiciary and lately the Election Commission.[5]
                
                The commission is headquartered at Dholpur House, in New Delhi, and functions through its secretariat. Established on 1 October 1926 as Public Service Commission, it was later reconstituted as Federal Public Service Commission by the Government of India Act 1935; only to be renamed as today's Union Public Service Commission after the independence.[6][7] The Royal Commission on the Superior Civil Services in India was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Lee of Fareham by the British Government in 1923.[8][6] With equal numbers of Indian and British members, the commission submitted its report in 1924, recommending setting up of a Public Service Commission.[9] The Lee Commission proposed that 40% of future entrants should be British, 40% Indians directly recruited, and 20% Indians promoted from the provincial services.[8][7]

                This led to the establishment of the first Public Service Commission on 1 October 1926 under the chairmanship of Sir Ross Barker.[6] A mere limited advisory function was granted to the Public Service Commission and the leaders of the freedom movement continually stressed on this aspect, which then resulted in the setting up of a Federal Public Service Commission under the Government of India Act 1935.[6][7]
                
                The Federal Public Service Commission became the Union Public Service Commission after independence. It was given a constitutional status under the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950.[9][7]
                
                In 1947, the then deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel called the recruits as the "steel frame of India".[1] As per Art. 316, the chairman and other members of the Union Public Service Commission shall be appointed by the president. In case the office of the chairman becomes vacant, the duties shall be performed by one of the other members of the Commission at the appointment of the President.[10]

                Also, nearly half of the members of the Commission shall be persons who at the dates of their respective appointments have held office for at least ten years either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State. A member of a Union Public Service Commission shall hold office for a term of six years from the date on which they enter upon the office or until they attain the age of sixty-five years, whichever is earlier. Under Art 318, the President is empowered to determine the number of members of the Commission and their conditions of service.[10]
                
                As per Art 319, a person who holds office as chairman shall, on the expiration of the term of office, be ineligible for re-appointment to that office. But, a member other than the chairman of the Union Public Service Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the chairman of the Union Public Service Commission, or as the chairman of a State Public Service Commission, but not for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government of a State. Also, the chairman of a State Public Service Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission.</p>

                <h2>EXAMINATION</h2>
                <p>The Civil Services Examination is based on the British era Imperial Civil Service tests, as well as the civil service tests conducted by old Indian empires such as the Mauryan Empire and Mughal Empire. It is one of the most difficult competitive examinations in not just India but across the world, with more than a million candidates every year. A single attempt can take two complete years of preparation - one year before the prelims and one year from the prelims to the interview. As of 2014, on an average, 900,000 to 1,000,000 candidates apply every year and the number of candidates sitting in the preliminary examination is approximately 550,000.[11] Results for the Prelims are published in mid-August, while the final result is published in May of the next year.

                    Stage I: Preliminary Examination - Held in June every year. Results are announced in August.
                    Stage II: Mains
                    Examination - Held in October every year. Results are announced in January.
                    Personality Test (interview) - Held in March. Final results are usually announced in May.
                    After the completion of the Medical examination of the successful candidates and other necessary formalities, the training program for the selected candidates usually commences the following September.</p>
